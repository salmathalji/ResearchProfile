### Vision

Drawing on my training in circadian neuroscience, neuroinformatics and electrical engineering, my vision is to help create a world where people can clearly understand how their everyday environments influence their wellbeing.

I want health wearable technologies to evolve into companions that translate continuously monitored physiological signals, behavioral habits and environmental exposures into insights that feel personal, practical and empowering.

I’m committed to being a leader in the health exposome movement and designing inclusive tools that honor gender, cultural and environmental diversity.
